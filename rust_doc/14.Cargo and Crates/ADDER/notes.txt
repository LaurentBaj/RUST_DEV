A workspace is a set of packages that share the same Cargo.lock and output directory.
This means that we can have multiple packages that depend on each other and even
share common external libraries. WS's make it easier to handle larger projects.

To create a workspace: mkdir an empty folder, then add a 'Cargo.toml' file.
The file needs to be annotated with: [workspace].
Libraries or binaries, that belong to the ws, need to be added as members in the toml.

In this project: 'adder' is a bin that depends on the library 'add-one'.
