    We use the enumerate method to adapt an iterator to produce 
    a value and that valueâ€™s index in the iterator, placed into 
    a tuple. The first value produced is the tuple (0, 'a'). 
    When this value is matched to the pattern (index, value), 
    index will be 0 and value will be 'a', printing the first line of the output."
